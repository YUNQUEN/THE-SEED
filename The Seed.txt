The Gamified Life Engine (GLE) is a system that turns your real life into a personal growth game. Instead of forcing you into preset categories, it lets you choose the main areas of life you want to improve. These areas become your main objectives (pillars) and the system helps you track progress, level up, and grow in the ways that matter most to you.


You can pick as many pillars as you want. Pillars are things such as:

• 	Wisdom (learning, decision‑making, mental growth)
• 	Physical State (health, strength, energy)
• 	Wealth (finances, career, long‑term stability)
• 	Legacy (impact, meaning, contribution)

Or you can define completely different ones based on your goals.
The idea is simple:

You decide what matters. The system turns it into a game you can win.

The way it does this is by giving you daily quest to complete that are bite size for you to reach your goals.

So from your main objective it then creates smaller objectives that slowly build and help you chive the main one.
